# Optomizer
An app made for Linux system to optomize your PC. Made in Java.

# How to Run
Download the "Optomizer.jar" and then,
Open the Terminal and locate to the download
Then run <pre> ```sudo java -jar filename ``` </pre> (write the download name in place of filename)
The "Optomizer.jar" will be located in the release section.

# Java
This app requires you to have Java 24 or above to be installed*. Sorry about the java version but it was need to implement more features.
V1.0.0, and V2.0.0beta use Java24 (Class version is 68).

# Why use Sudo?
This app changes the priority of the app by pid and to do that you need admin prevelages.
the "reniance" command in linux usually requires root permissions to run.

# How to Use?
after running "sudo java -jar Optomizer.jar" you will launch the app and then there will be a text feild where you can enter the PID of the app you want to set. Entering the wrong PID could lead to negative performance.
If you do not know the PID of your app then you can go the System monitor and check app PID there.

# It should look something like this*:
